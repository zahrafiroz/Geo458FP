## Project description: We will be researching the amount of rainfall in Seattle. This data will show the past five years and the total amount of rain in the city. We will be visualizing this research through a smart dashboard that offers as much information to the viewers as possible without being too overwhelming and distracting. It will work to offer information quickly and efficiently while also showing how useful this information can be because of the way the data is used and visualized. 
This project will cover different elements of the rainfall and GIS experience which can be toggled with and maneuvered through the smart dashboard to give the most information at each level the user is seeking. It will cover a great deal of statistics and offer information on floor risks in the city which can be used for research and legislation. This project is meant to be open to anyone in need of the information. Specifically tourists or residents of the area as they can use it to fit their needs such as what to pack or wear.

An overview of our smart dashboard that is able to be changed based on the users input and layer selection. We also use the hover tool which makes it so everyone is able to recieve the information that is vital to them and their needs. 


## Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?):
This project provides a detailed analysis of rainfall patterns that are crucial for studying climate change impacts, water resource management, and ecosystem health within the Seattle area. The weather and climate is also in need of study and research on weather patterns and annual change that is helpful for funding and further understanding and legislation. By understanding localized rainfall patterns helps in planning flood defenses, sewage and drainage systems, and other critical infrastructure and legislation.

# Our Process:
## Determine the reasonable functions that can be done by the end of this quarter:

Some of the reasonable functions that can be done by the end of the quarter is to offer easier visualization of the data to a greater degree than can be done with the data alone through any other means of visualization, as through the toggling of the different elements, as mentioned in the project description it will be able to display the information in the manner that the user of the dashboard can use to fit their needs and preferences all while being quick and efficient. 
Some of the functions include being able to click on a portion of the data and have it be highlighted on the screen by isolating those specific instances as well as having a table that shows the different classes of rainfall. We also want to have a description of the data and what the dashboard is attempting to show to the user. The dashboard will also be able to display the amount of rainfall in a specific region that the user zooms into and show that reflection on the table. These are some of the features that can be done by the end of the quarter, and we hope to have additional features that cannot be listed here, but we will make those features known in the project descriptions.

## Identify the target audience:

This project is tailored for a broad audience, including academic instructors and students in GIS and geography, GIS professionals, environmental researchers, local government officials, urban planners, and the Seattle public interested in the city's climate. This project demonstrates advanced GIS applications through a smart dashboard visualizing Seattle's rainfall data over five years. It aims to engage users with effective data presentation and provide insights into the city's rainfall patterns for educational, planning, and general interest purposes, emphasizing the practical use of GIS skills in analyzing and communicating complex environmental information. 
Environmental researchers stand to benefit significantly from the project, as it provides a detailed analysis of rainfall patterns, crucial for studying climate change impacts, water resource management, and ecosystem health within the Seattle area. This data is not only relevant for academic and scientific inquiries but also for local government officials and urban planners who are tasked with developing infrastructure and urban policies that are resilient to weather variations and climate change. Understanding localized rainfall patterns helps in planning flood defenses, sewage and drainage systems, and other critical infrastructure, ensuring they are equipped to handle the city's unique climatic challenges.

## The required multimedia:

The required multimedia for this project are mainly images, graphs, and visual maps. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing way for viewers to understand the rainfall patterns from the gathered information and datasets. We will use our skills and knowledge of QGIS to make maps of Seattle’s rainfall patterns which will then be turned into an image. Graphs also may provide a visual representation of the rainfall patterns better for certain circumstances, but this multimedia will be used in a way that can contribute to our own understanding of the data so we can properly display the results onto a thematic map - the majority of our multimedia is what we will be adapting [visualize our data and statistics] such as line/bar graphs.
